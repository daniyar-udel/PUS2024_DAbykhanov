I worked with Philly parks data. Providie discriptive statistics and formualte scientific hypothesis. That was very interesting experience for me, because I worked with real data and formulate hypothesis which would be helpfull in the future for Philly parks. Also I worked with citibike data and provide hypothesis which could be performe in the future.
I was working by myself.
