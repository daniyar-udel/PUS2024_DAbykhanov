Hello! My name is Daniyar Abykhanov. I graduated this year with a bachelor’s degree in Data Science and am now pursuing my graduate studies at the University of Delaware, majoring in Data Science.
I decided to take this class because I want to apply my knowledge in practice and gain new insights in the field of Urban Data Science. I’m looking forward to engaging in practical tasks and exploring interesting data analysis techniques.
