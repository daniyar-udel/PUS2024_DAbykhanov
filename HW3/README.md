I worked with data about effectivenes_of_NYC_Post_Prison_Employment_Programs that was very interesting for me, because I create H0 and Ha hypothesis and perform Z TEST and X**2 Test and evaluate the results.
I worked with data about waterconsumption that was very interesting, I tried different techniques in data analysis and also provide different ml algorithms and evaluate the results.
